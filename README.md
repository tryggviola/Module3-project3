## Project Brief

Create a a site using Bootstrap

## The Goal

<li>Understand what front-end / UI frameworks are</li>
<li>Be able to use front-end / UI framework</li>
<li>Use Bootstrap</li>

## Intro

I wanted to create a a website for a software that I named Power B using only Bootstrap.

## The Process

I started with creating the site in <strong>Figma</strong> and I wanted it to be really responsive so I started creating the mobile version first and then the desktop version. Then I designed the logo and the barcode in <strong>Illustrator</strong> once I had my colour pallet and look that I liked. After the design was done I put everything together in <strong>VS Studio</strong>.

I started the process looking at the Bootstrap site (https://getbootstrap.com) too learn about Bootstrap and all the components they have to offer. After I found out what tools I wanted to use I designed the site in <strong>Figma</strong> and created a logo in <strong>Illustrator</strong>. After that I created the HTML in <strong>VS Code</strong>.

## The Journey

Bootstrap was for me a little tricky but with the help from <strong>The Net Ninja</strong> and his great Bootstrap 5 Crash Course Tutorial on <strong>YouTube</strong> it all started to make a little bit of sense. Finding the right components on the Bootstrap site and adapting it to your project was hard but in the end it came together and I learned alot about Bootstrap and how it can be useful in the future.

## What I liked

I liked that I had to design the page with Bootstrap in mind and I though it was really limited but in the end it came out good and I learned alot by imitading things in Figma that already exist. I also like that you dont have to worry about how it scales, everything is accounted for so it is really simple to do.

## The Conclusion

Using Bootstrap sometimes feels like you are stealing and cheating but once you get passed that it is really nice to use and there are so many cool things that you can do really quickly. The coding part of it was a little tricky for me and not using a stylesheet was difficult put I learned alot by doing it.
